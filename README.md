# NLP-FinHeadlines-MoodTracker

NLP-FinHeadlines-MoodTracker is an NLP project that performs sentiment analysis on financial news headlines. It aims to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with the news headlines and track the overall mood in the financial market. The project utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for sentiment classification.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing: The financial news headlines are preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize the text, and perform other necessary cleaning steps.
- Word embedding: The project uses pre-trained word embeddings to represent words as dense vectors and capture semantic relationships.
- Sentiment analysis model: The model consists of an embedding layer, 1D convolution, max pooling, bidirectional LSTM, dropout, and dense layer for sentiment classification.
- Training and evaluation: The model is trained on a labeled dataset of financial news headlines and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- Mood tracking: The model's predictions are used to track the overall sentiment or mood in the financial market.
